# hello-world
just had to try it out.
Hello world, my name is Ochuo, also known as Ochuowo. Ever since the first day I discovered computers, I just wanted to get to know more about them and what they can do.
New technology always fascinates me beyond imagination, every chance I come accross new devices or new software, a spark lights up inside (*), wanting to dig deeper and to find out a bit more about the latest break-throughs or the newest kid on the block with an amazing invention.
Between hardware and software, I chose software for one reason, the ability to touch and change lives accross the globe, this is a calling I am more than willing to answer at any given time,any given place.
This is why I became a full stack developer, specializing in Java, sql, C#, vba and node js. I can create desktop, mobile as well as web applications, supporting both the frontend and backend, as well as middle auth-ware, as and when is required.
In case you wanna talk...my email is otiato.paul@gmail.com. Feel free to get in touch and maybe we can talk some more.
Thanks & have a good day!
